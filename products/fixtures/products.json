The complex composition, built on the contrast of fresh and smoky, dry and almost gourmand, is as unconventional and modern as the name suggests. We love how perfectly the sweet smokiness of tobacco mixed with cocoa balances the striking freshness of the citrusy top notes. The incense and leather blend in the heart of the fragrance is incredibly alluring, a brooding, dark and handsome accord that we find irresistible.",
