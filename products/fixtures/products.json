            "description": "The newest addition to the Gucci Bloom bouquet is a lighter, more luminous interpretation of the original scent that gently encourages women become the truest version of themselves. Developed wholly under the idea of the House’s Creative Director, Alessandro Michele, the fragrance is characterized by a trio of Jasmine Bud extract, Tuberose and Rangoon Creeper. Further enriching the scent, a honeyed sweetness and green citrus facet is captured through the addition of Neroli accord—its delicate freshness and ethereal radiance embody the glowing twist on Bloom’s white floral signature.",
