## Automated Testing

## Unsolved Known Bugs

* #### Product price

    The product prices are displayed dynamically based on the sizes selected when adding product into the cart. However, the price is not corect on the cart overview page and on the checkout. I tried a couple of different ways to solve the problem but I couldn't make it work due to current knowledge and skills.

* #### Wishlist count

    The total count on the wishlist page doesn't work.

* #### Product management form

    The product management forms don't work properly.


### W3C HTML validation errors and warnings

To correct the errors and get rid of the warnings, I deleted the duplicated ids, hrefs, script type attribute and the spaces between the names of brands.
