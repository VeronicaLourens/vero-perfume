## Wireframes
I used ```Balsamiq``` to create basic site structure to visualize the site’s potential features which helps me to understand better what needs to be done for the project. The end result might slightly different due to the project development.

## Design Choice
The site uses white background with high quality colorful images in a carousel sideshow for the landing page. The site is intuitive with great color contrast which is very user friendly. The project is designed for potentially being used in a real e-commerce online web shop that can be used for both the shopper and the site owner. The application was created using Django MVC structure.

### Color Scheme

I have chosen the white color for the site's background and using purple and blue colors for the buttons.
    ![Color theme](https://veroperfume.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/readme-pics/color-theme.png)

## Agile Project Management
I used GitHub Agile project management tool to create user stories using issues and planned the user stories into three different stages using Kanban board with three columns that are ```To do```, ```In progress``` and ```Done```. The user stories are labeled with **MoSCoW** techniques to prioritize the project’s tasks.

![Agile](https://veroperfume.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/readme-pics/agile.png)

### Database ERD
I used ```Lucidchart``` to create the project's database schema models which helps me to unserstand the relationship between the models. Heroku Postgres database and the SQLite are used for the project.
    ![ERD](https://veroperfume.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/readme-pics/ERD.png)

#### Models
* **User** - It is used for user information and purchase history.
* **Django User** - It is the Django built-in User model.
* **Product** - It is used for the product information.
* **Catagory** - It is used for the category of the products.
* **Brand** - It is used for the product's brand.
* **OrderLineItem** - It is used for combining the product with the order.
* **Order** - It is used for the order placed by the user when processing online purchase.
* **Review** - It is used for the customer to review the product / shop.
* **Wishlist** - It is used for the shopper to save a product on their wishlist for easy access.
### Business Model
The Vero Perfume application is a B2C business model that it does the business directly with the end customer. Customer is able to search the product on the site, complete the order, make a payment through secured payment system and receive goods in the end.
* #### Marketing
    Vero Perfume has a Facebook page for reaching all the customers instantly. Shop owner is able to post any updates or promotions to gather sales. The Facebook page provides a great effective way of communicating with shoppers.

    I created ```Vero Perfume Facebook page```. However, the page was only for the education purpose of the e-commerce project and it's not a real business page. Therefore, I made a screenshot of the Facebook page and deleted it afterwards in order to avoid any problems under Facebook's rules. The Facebook link in the footer opens the link to Facebook but not the actual ```Vero Perfume Facebook page```. Here is the one but deleted page.

    ![Vero Perfume Facebook page](https://veroperfume.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/readme-pics/vero-fackbook.png)

* #### Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
    I added two meta tags with names of keywords and description on the page head, and I generated robots.txt and sitemap.xml to make sure Google and search engines crawl the site.

* #### Mailchimp newsletter subscription
    Vero Perfume sends out regular newsletters and user can subscribe using email address. This is a great way for store owner to reach out existing and potential customers with any updates or promotions.


# Exisiting Features
All of pages has the same navigation menu and the same footer. The navigatoin menu provides an easy way of browsing the site.

## Home Page
The site's landing page with carousel images to show what the online shop sells.

## Content

* Vero Perfume project was inspired by [Code Institute]()'s walk through project ```Boutique Ado```. The code for setting up the e-commerce project, product page, shopping cart, the Stripe payment system as well as the JS code are taken and adapted from the tutorial materials.

* I use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to get some of product images and other information.
* I couldn't find the perfume images from the famous brands on the free image website so that I use the official websites to get the product images and other information.

# Acknowledgement

Whilst I have tried to deviate as much as possible, I have taken the certain code from the walk through e-commerce project ```Boutique Ado``` at Code Institute which I learn how to build the e-commerce website for a real world application.

I relied upon the support from Code Institue online [tutors](), mentor [Precious Ijege](), [Slack]() community and my [families](). Great thanks to all of those who support my learning journey.

I use ```Django``` documentation, ```W3schools```, ```YouTube``` and ```Stack Overflow``` for general references throughout the project. I watched the tutorial videos on Youtube to gain extra knowledge about Django framework.

[Vero Perfume](https://veroperfume.herokuapp.com/) website is intended for education purpose of completing the Portfolio Project 5 E-commerce project for the Diploma of Full Stack Software Development course at [Code Institue]().
