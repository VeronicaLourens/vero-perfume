# UX
## Agile Project Management
I used GitHub Agile project management tool to create user stories using issues and planned the user stories into three different stages using Kanban board with three columns that are ```To do```, ```In progress``` and ```Done```. The user stories are labeled with **MoSCoW** techniques to prioritize the projectâ€™s tasks.

## Wireframes
I used ```Balsamiq``` to create basic site structure to visualize the siteâ€™s potential features which helps me to understand better what needs to be done for the project. The end result might slightly different due to the project development.

* ### Desktop
* ### Mobile
## Design Choice
The site uses white background with high quality colorful images in a carousel sideshow for the landing page. The site is intuitive with great color contrast which is very user friendly. The project is designed for potentially being used in a real e-commerce online web shop that can be used for both the shopper and the site owner. The application was created using Django MVC structure.
